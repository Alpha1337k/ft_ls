# ft_ls
As simple as listing the files in a directory.

***Final grade***: [104 / 100]


Mimic `ls` with the following constraints
- implement the following options: -l -a -R -r -t
- You do not have to deal with the multiple column format for the exit when the option -l isnâ€™t in the arguments.
- You are not required to deal with ACL and extended attributes.
- The overall display, depending on each option, must stay as identical as possible to the system command. We will be cordial when grading either the
padding or the pagination, but no information can be missing
